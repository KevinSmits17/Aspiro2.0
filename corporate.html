      <h2>Marketing</h2>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
      <p>With our campaign we want to motivate people to take matters into their own hands and get more active. Through are brand we want to give those people more confidence when they are working out. A lot of people are not secure enough about themselves with for example their body. That is where we as a brand get into action. Our aim is to let those people belief more in themselves and let them feel confident in their own skin.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>- Reach objectives: With the start of our social media campaign, we hope to achieve 100 Instagram followers and 300 impressions on our posts.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>- Affect objectives: We want to motivate our target audience to workout! With our campaign we want to let them believe in themselves and take matters into their own hands. Starting in the gym can sometimes be a challenge en we want them to take that first step by starting in the gym and workout.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>- Response objectives: Through this campaign we want to achieve that our target audience starts working out more and believe a little bit more in themselves. To do this we want our target audience to buy our gymwear, because our gymwear supports them to be more confident in the gym. </p>
<p>For our social media campaign we will use Instagram. We have chosen this platform because it fits our target audience. We have chosen to only use Instagram because it is, next to Snapchat, the only platform that fits our entire platform. Platform like Tiktok are not very popular among our target audience, but more used between the age of 13 and 17. Instagram is also an widely used platform for brands to promote their product or service on. Therefore we believe that with Instagram we can achieve our goal of motivating people by using pictures on Instagram and spreading our message to let people take matters into their own hand. Instagram also has the function of selling products on their platforms which makes it more easier for us to sell our products. A plus for Instagram is that you can also see your insights on what your reach is etc. And above all, you can create a community on Instagram on which you can build trustful followers. &nbsp;</p>

      <h4 class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
      <p>One of the learning points we have encountered at the early stages of the project were planning. We noticed that we were a bit chaotic and not well organized. This cases us to fall behind and that we had to make a big catch up in the weeks following up. So, after noticing that we were not organized enough we made a clear planning schedule on Trello with deadlines that we made up ourselves to ensure that we were on the right track and did not fall behind again. Therefore, one of the learning points for future projects is to have a clear schedule and deadlines for the group to create a clear overview and structure for ourselves.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
      <p>For this project we have created a brand related towards gymwear. After interviewing people we found out that we want to make a hoodie that would fit the problems of our target audience. After creating a hoodie we started promoting the brand on social media and on our website. If we would continue with this project we would definitly expand our collection and our research on the problems that exist with gymwear, to get a better understanding on our target audience and their wishes.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p>If this campaign would continue we would extend our social media campaign to other platforms like for example Tiktok. This for the reason that we could widen our reach and gain more followers and potential buyers towards our brand. We would also then be more active on it an create for example giveaways to attracte more audience and gain more followers.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
      <p>If we reflect back on what has been done and what we could do better towards marketing we would need to more clear towards each other and have a clear structure for planning. We started a bit chaotic in the beginnen like we said in our learnings points and that therefore also had an effect on the marketing part as well. We did not communicate clearly what and at what time we needed to pos on Instagram. Next to that we did not clearly communicated with each other on what sort of marketing content we needed on our website and therefore also was a bit chaotic on what needed to be where and how we wanted it to be. So looking back at it we needed to have a clear structure and clear communication towards each other.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>
      <p>Present and organize below all social media/online activities of the campaign. Context and material are according to the brand style, image, and vision. Images on the site are of high-quality, readable, and properly designed.</p>
